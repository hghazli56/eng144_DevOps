<h2>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>
<br></br>
<h3>What is OOP?</h3>
<br>
Before OOP, developers utilized procedural programming in which code was kept in one place and operated on data which was stored separately. However,  downsides of procedural programming include:

<br></br>
1. Data is separated from functions resulting in a lack of modularity
<br></br>
2. High coupling between code and data makes code re-use difficult
<br></br>
3. Does not model real world (data and entities that operate on said data are not usually separate)

<br>
<br>
OOP differs in that it combines data with the entities(methods) that operate on it. This combination is commonly known a class.Benefits of this include:

<br></br>
1. Data and functions are combined allowing for better modularity
<br></br>
2. Low coupling makes re-use easier
<br></br>
3. Closely models the real world

<br>
<br>
There are 4 main principles of OOP. These are:

<br></br>
1. Abstraction
<br></br>
2. Encapsulation
<br></br>
3. Inheritance
<br></br>
4. Polymorphism

<br></br>

<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<br>
Abstraction is the process of breaking down an object into common components and attributes that make up or describe said object. For example, a car can be broken down to a chassis, body, engine, wheels, colour, weight etc.
<br></br>
In programming a unit of abstraction is commonly called a class which contains the data of an object along with the methods or functions to be performed on the data. An instance within a class is called an object.
<br></br>
<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
<br>
Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the data and its implementation inside an object so that the user only sees what they need to see with the aim of simplifying the user experience. The user can access the output of a class function but will not have to see how it works.
<br></br>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<br>
In the real world many objects come in different types that share the same set of general attributes but also have attributes specific to their types. For example, all mammals have a brain and a heart but some mammal types have tails while others have claws. In terms of programming, a Superclass contains all the general attributes that specific objects have while a Subclass inherits the general attributes as well as containing more specialised attributes. Subclasses can also be Superclasses(and vice versa) for more levels of categorization. 
<br></br>
<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
<br>
Polymorphism is the concept of sending the same message to different classes in which they they generate outputs specific to them. For example, sending the same "start" command to the classes "add" and "subtract" will produce different results from both of them.
